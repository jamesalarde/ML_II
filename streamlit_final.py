    #### :clipboard: Project Overview
    This project uses Machine Learning to generate product descriptions for e-commerce startups. The goal is to automate a portion of the startup process by generating product descriptions using AI, effectively saving time and resources.
    By using AI, high-quality product descriptions can be generated that are tailored to the specific needs of each startup, and friendly towards search engines.

    #### :hammer_and_wrench: Methodology
    The group obtained the dataset of Amazon UK products to do a style analysis and to check usual product descriptions uploaded in their online store. The dataset can be accessed here : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/amazon-uk-products-dataset-2023

    The following steps were taken to create the model :
    1. Style Analysis
    2. Prompt Engineering & Validation
    3. User Interface Deployment
    
    Below is the general flow of the model.

    #### :bar_chart: Style Analysis
    The group analyzed the dataset to understand the style of product descriptions used in Amazon UK. The analysis included:
    - **Sentence Length** : the average sentence length was calculated to understand the complexity of the descriptions
    - **Tone Analysis** : the tone of the descriptions leaned towards friendly and professional, with some playful elements
    - **Functionality Highlighting** : the descriptions highlighted the functionality of the products, as this is a key aspect of effective product descriptions
             
    #### :traffic_light: Prompt Engineering & Validation
    The group used a sequential chain to generate the product descriptions.
    - The first prompt generates a three-line product description based on the product name and information.
    - The second step edits the generated description to match the selected tone.
    
    The final output is a three-sentence product description stylized to match the Amazon UK product descriptions in the dataset.
    
    #### :control_knobs: User Interface Deployment
    The group created a user interface using Streamlit to allow users to upload their own CSV files containing product names and information.
    The model generates descriptions based on the uploaded data and allows users to 1) choose their desired tone and 2) download the generated results.
